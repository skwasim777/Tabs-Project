# Tabs Project

This project demonstrates a basic tab functionality using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to navigate between different steps or sections by clicking on corresponding buttons. Each step is associated with specific content that is displayed when its respective button is clicked.

## Getting Started
To view the Tabs Project, follow these steps:
1. Clone or download the project repository to your local machine.
2. Open the index.html file in your preferred web browser.
## Project Structure
- **index.html**: The main HTML file that structures the content and includes the necessary scripts and styles.
- **styles.css**: The stylesheet defining the project's visual appearance.
- **app.js**: The JavaScript file that handles the tab functionality.

## Usage
1. Upon opening the project in a web browser, you will see a set of buttons labeled "Step 1," "Step 2," and "Step 3."

2. Clicking on each button will reveal the corresponding content associated with that step.

3. The content is visually highlighted, and the button for the active step is differentiated by a different background color.
